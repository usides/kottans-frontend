## Git Basics

**Feedback:**

I had some basic knowledge about Git but after these series of lessons I enhanced my knowlege:

- I configurated terminal for convinient use of Git
- Understood how logically split commits and name them properly
- Found new Git commands that I haven't used before (revert and reset)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

- [Linux Survival (1 module)](https://github.com/usides/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/2020-10-13_16-04.png?raw=true)
- [Linux Survival (2 module)](https://github.com/usides/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/2020-10-13_16-23.png?raw=true)
- [Linux Survival (3 module)](https://github.com/usides/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/2020-10-13_16-38.png?raw=true)
- [Linux Survival (4 module)](https://github.com/usides/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/2020-10-13_16-53.png?raw=true)

**Feedback:**

- **Linux Survival**

I have been using bash for a long time, so I didn't find any new info in the first task. But I liked that this task has a game-style approach and a "virtual" bash environment. It should be useful for people who started to work with the terminal recently.

- **HTTP protocol**

I have only surface knowledge about HTTP protocol, and these articles revealed some points, but I still don't truly understand most of them (caching, authentication). It should be more clear when I connect this knowledge with practical work.

## Git Collaboration

- [Udacity - GitHub & Collaboration](https://github.com/usides/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/2020-10-14_15-42.png?raw=true)

**Feedback:**

This course was practical and helpful as I didn't have the collaboration experience on GitHub before.

- I managed to set up an SSL connection to GitHub
- Understood how to work with upstream branches, create forks, and use commands like fetch and rebase

**Feedback:**

- Udacity - Intro to HTML and CSS

  Information in this subtask wasn't new for me, but this video is good to get a general understanding of HTML and CSS for newcomers.

- Codecademy - Learn HTML

  This subtask has more deep knowledge base about HTML.<br />
  I refreshed my knowledge about tables and forms.

- Codecademy - Learn CSS

  Making this subtask, I improved my knowledge about transitions, grid systems, and **!important** declaration. <br />
  All this knowledge will be useful.

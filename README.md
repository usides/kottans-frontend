## Git Basics
I had some basic knowledge about Git but after these series of lessons I enhanced my knowlege.
1. I configurated terminal for convinient use of Git;
2. Understood how logically split commits and name them properly;
3. Found new Git commands that I haven't used before (revert and reset).

## Git Basics
I had some basic knowledge about Git but after these series of lessons I enhanced my knowlege.
1. I configurated terminal for convinient use of Git;
2. Understood how logically split commits and name them properly;
3. Found new Git commands that I haven't used before (revert and reset).

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
1. I have been using bash for a long time, so I didn't find any new info in the first task. But I liked that this task has a game-style approach and a "virtual" bash environment. It should be useful for people who started to work with the terminal recently.
2. I have only surface knowledge about HTTP protocol, and these articles revealed some points, but I still don't truly understand most of them. It should be more clear when I connect this knowledge with practical work.
